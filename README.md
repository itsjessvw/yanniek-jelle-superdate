Hello Yanniek and Jelle!
For your wedding gift, we are giving you super date advice (although you are definitely the much more experienced super daters!)!! This is the plan:

1. Travel to Freneker. In case you don't know where that is - it is quite far: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Franeker,+Netherlands/@53.1834138,5.4776354,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c8e157ced7d29b:0xdab2610f3e2f0bb8!8m2!3d53.1888206!4d5.5564857
2. It's a long ass ride (or train drive if you're saving on petrol), so you need a little refreshment and some lunch here: https://www.brasseriedestadstuin.nl
3. Once you've had your uitsmijter and Lipton green ice tea, you can head off and discover old planets at the Koninklijke Eisa Eisinga Planetarium: https://www.planetarium-friesland.nl/en/the-planetarium/
4. When you've been all planeted out, cross the canal and have a stroll around the Franeker City hall. It looks quite impressive from the inside if you can get a peak!: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Franeker+City+Hall,+8801+KX+Franeker,+Netherlands/@53.186944,5.5411443,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c8e1461a85eb41:0x7432247fef3516cf!8m2!3d53.186944!4d5.543333
5. Now we're out of ideas, just walk around this cutsie town and see what you can come across :D

It's up to you to take this advice or leave it. Either way, this free advice includes a 100 euro gift card (in a form of a Tikkie once you read this lol).

Enjoy!!!!

Love, Jess and Adam
